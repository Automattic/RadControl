Harness the power of WordPress.com's advertising partners for your own website.

== Description ==

With traditional advertising relationships a publisher or blogger has two relationships and platforms--one for publishing and the other for advertising. AdControl combines the two partnerships into one.

AdControl is a new service from Automattic that extends our advertising scale and know-how to eligible sites using WordPress. We believe it is a special partnership between the largest Internet publishing platform and our users. The team at AdControl and WordPress.com are very excited about the potential to help our self-hosted publishers to earn income from their sites with high quality ads and strong rates from advertisers.

== Installation ==

Since the plugin is in its early stages, there are a couple additional configuration steps:

1. [Install and activate Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/installation/)
1. Upload `AdControl` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Accept the Terms of Service and fill in other options in the Dashboard -> Settings -> AdControl page
