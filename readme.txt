Harness WordPress.com's advertising partners for your own website.

== Description ==

With traditional advertising relationships a publisher or blogger has two relationships and platforms--one for publishing and the other for advertising. AdControl combines the two partnerships into one.

AdControl is a new service from Automattic that extends our advertising scale and know-how to eligible sites using WordPress. We believe it is a special partnership between the largest Internet publishing platform and our users. The team at AdControl and WordPress.com are very excited about the potential to help our self-hosted publishers to earn income from their sites with high quality ads and strong rates from advertisers.

Make sure you [apply to WordAds](https://wordads.co/signup/) for each site you want to run AdControl on.
